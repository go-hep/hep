# Motivations

Writing analyses in HEP involves many steps and one needs a few tools to
successfully carry out such an endeavour.
But - at minima - one needs to be able to read (and possibly write) ROOT files
to be able to interoperate with the rest of the HEP community or to insert
one's work into an already existing analysis pipeline.

Go-HEP provides this necessary interoperability layer, in the Go programming
language.
This allows physicists to leverage the great concurrency primitives of Go,
together with the surrounding tooling and software engineering ecosystem of Go,
to implement physics analyses.

## Installation

Go-HEP packages are installable via the `go get` command:

```sh
$ go get go-hep.org/x/hep/fads
```

Just select the package you are interested in and `go get` will take care of fetching, building and installing it, as well as its dependencies, recursively.
