# Summary

Go-HEP provides tools to interface with CERN's ROOT [@ROOT] software
framework and carry analyses or data acquisition from within the Go [@Go]
programming language.

Go-HEP exposes libraries to read and write common High Energy Physics (HEP)
file formats (HepMC [@HepMC], LHEF [@LHEF], SLHA [@SLHA]) but, at the
moment, only read interoperability is achieved with ROOT file format.
Go-HEP also provides tools to carry statistical analyses in the form of
1-dim and 2-dim histograms, 1-dim and 2-dim scatters and n-tuples.
Go-HEP can also graphically represent these results, leveraging the
Gonum [@Gonum] plotting library.
