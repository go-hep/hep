// Package protocol contains the structures describing request and response

//
// A response consists of 3 parts:
//
// 1) GeneralResponse - general response that is always returned and specifies protocol version and flags describing server type.
//
// 2) SecurityInfo - a response part that is added to the general response
// if `ReturnSecurityRequirements` is provided and server supports it.
// It contains the security version, the security options, the security level,
// and the number of following security overrides, if any.
//
// 3) A list of SecurityOverride - alterations needed to the specified predefined security level.
